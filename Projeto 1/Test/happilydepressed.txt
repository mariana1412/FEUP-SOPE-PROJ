I'm happily depressed
And I know
I’ve nothing to complain about

Oh-oh-oh
It's just that I'm concerned
Even if
There’s nothing to be afraid about

I'm happily depressed
And you know
There is nothing to be proud about

Oh
It comes with some regrets
It's the price
Of constant dreaming on a couch

I'm happily depressed
And I know
I've nothing to complain about

Someone help me out, today
My head is hiding underground
I want to lift myself, today
